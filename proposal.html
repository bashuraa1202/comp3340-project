        <h2>Description</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                We will make an e-commerce website that sells fruits and vegetables from the source (farmers) directly to the consumers, cutting out the middlemen (grocery stores). 
                Conceptually we will create a database with our farmers that we partner with in Ontario (In the future across Canada and USA),
                and within that database we will have each of our farmers stock of fruit and vegetables updated live on our site so that the consumer will never order our product 
                if there is no stock available. Our store will be a concept store that is looking to disrupt the agriculture supply chain by laying the foundational infrastructure
                for drone delivery systems in the food industry. In the future, we will set up a system that as soon as you order our site will tell you when the next available drone will 
                deliver your order (assuming you are in our delivery jurisdiction) and will track the flight and time of the drone. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Our site will look similar to a standard shopping site with different features such as produce that is on sale, produce that is in season, recently viewed produce, produce 
                we think you will enjoy based off your recent search history, produce bundles and packages that you can purchase and reviews/FAQ.
                We will also have an interactive map, for example, it would show a map of Ontario and there will be dots on the map representing farms that we partner with. When you click on 
                the dot it will show some brief information about the farm and some contact information and maybe even a link to the farm's social media or website to offer transparency to the consumer.
                We will also make a chatbot that can answer general questions and direct the consumer to different parts of the site or show some deals.  
            </p>
